The final goal of this project is to create a fully functional 8-bit computer with it's own central proccessor, I/O management, device management, etc. 
completely out of discrete TTL components at the logic gate level. After I am finished and the design is finalized, the next goal is to redesign the
CPU on the transistor level with CMOSET and make it into an integrated circuit, and to embed that processeor in other devices.
